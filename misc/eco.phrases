		reasmb: Since 2016, an average of 28 million hectares have been cut down every year.
		reasmb: In 2016, a record of 29.7 million hectares of forest disappeared.
		reasmb: In just 40 years, a forest area the size of Europe has gone - 1 billion hectares.
		reasmb: Half of the worldâ€™s rainforest has been destroyed in just one century.

	decomp: where *
		reasmb: The Amazon forest is affected greatly.
		reasmb: In August of 2019, over 30.000 individual fires in the Amazon - three times the usual number.
    decomp: why * happen *
		reasmb: Overuse of paper is one essential part.
	decomp: why * bad *
		reasmb: The loss of tree cover has a number of negative effects on the planet such as animal extinction, climate change, etc.
		reasmb: Deforestation destroys wildlife habitat and is a key reason for animal extinction.
		reasmb: The clearing of forests is a big contributor to global climate change.
		reasmb: Trees are essential to the water cycle. In the rainforest ecosystem, over half the water is held within plants as absorbed rainfall and three quarters of the worldâ€™s freshwater is supplied by forest catchments.
		reasmb: Without the roots of trees to anchor the soil, it washes away including the nutrients contained in the soil.
		reasmb: If soil erosion is not stopped it can ultimately turn the land into desert.
		reasmb: In the Amazon, the loss of a critical mass of rain forest could trick further dieback moving the forest into a vicious circle of self reinforcing destruction.
