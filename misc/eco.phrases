key: forest
	decomp: what is * forest

		reasmb:
	decomp: how many * destroyed

	decomp: where *
		reasmb: The Amazon forest is directly affected.
		reasmb: In August of 2019, over 30.000 individual fires in the Amazon. Three times the usual number.
	decomp: why * happen
		reasmb: Overuse of paper is one essential part.
	decomp: why * bad
		reasmb: The loss of tree cover has a number of negative effects on the planet.
		reasmb: Deforestation destroys wildlife habitat and is a key reason for animal extinction.
		reasmb: The clearing of forests is a big contributor to global climate change.
		reasmb: Trees are essential to the water cycle. In the rainforest ecosystem, over half the water is held within plants as absorbed rainfall and three quarters of the worldâ€™s freshwater is supplied by forest catchments.
		reasmb: Without the roots of trees to anchor the soil, it washes away including the nutrients contained in the soil.
		reasmb: If soil erosion is not stopped it can ultimately turn the land into desert.
		reasmb: In the Amazon, the loss of a critical mass of rain forest could trick further dieback moving the forest into a vicious circle of self reinforcing destruction.
		reasmb: The loss of tree cover has a number of negative effects on the planet.
	decomp: * help *

		reasmb: Something really needs to change. The world population is growing by the minute and so is the global consumer class.
