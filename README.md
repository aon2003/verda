Verda is a chatbot that helps you **understand** and **react** appropiately to the the problems which surround us.

### How can Verda help us?

The amount of precious resources that our planet provides us are declining daily - and all of that is our own fault. Deforestation, biodiversity loss and plastic pollution are only a small portion of the global disaster. Living our lives without complying to the nature's laws is not doing us any good and we have to find a way to change this.

Thus, our idea - Verda. A chatbot, which gives you information about matured problems and alternative solutions to them.

### Who are we?

We are four 11-graders who want to help in the battle with the ecological problems.
